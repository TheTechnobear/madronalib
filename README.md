Design Notes
------------

To get reliable audio performance in a multiprocessing system, careful attention must be paid to memory allocation, shared object access, and any use of OS calls. (see: http://www.rossbencina.com/code/real-time-audio-programming-101-time-waits-for-nothing) Madronalib encapsulates these concerns and provides a simple API to the writers of audio applications. 

The most maintainable code is no code. With the advent of C++11, lots of functionality that previously required external libraries became available as part of C++. Madronalib leans on C++11 to reduce its code footprint. 

Making new modules such as oscillators and filters is straightforward. The syntax of the signal library encourages code to reflect the underlying DSP equations with a minimum of overhead. There are no weird macros to learn. 

Madronalib makes it possible to do DSP efficiently with very readable code. Where the goals of readability and efficiency are in conflict, madronalib favors readability. 

The Google C++ style guidelines (https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html) are followed, for the most part. Any exceptions are well documented. 


Status
----------

Madronalib began as the common code supporting the Madrona Labs synthesizer products Aalto and Kaivo, as well as the open-source application for the Soundplane controller. All of this support code is currently present in the repository, but most is not part of the library build. Individual modules are being brought into the library as they are being reviewed, modernized and documented.

See the issues for planned functionality that is currently not present in any form.
